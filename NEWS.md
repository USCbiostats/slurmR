# slurmR 0.5-0

*  `sourceSlurm(plan = "collect")` won't wait forever.

*  More verbose error messages when `Slurm_collect` returns with errors.

*  The function `sacct()` now doesn't fail when accounting is not available.

*  slurmR now has a Dockerimage that can be used to test with a Slurm cluster.
   The docker image can be started from within R (if Docker is available).

*  `makeSlurmCluster()`s default tmp_path is now `opts_slurmR$get_tmp_path()`.

*  New functions `slurmr_docker_*` provide a wrapper to interact with the
   Dockerimage of slurmR.


# slurmR 0.4-3 (CRAN)

Minor release.

## New features

*  Added a `preamble` option for Slurm batch scripts. This allows the user to
   specify commands that need to be added to the script, e.g., `module load`.
  
*  `preamble` can be specified via `opts_slurmR$set_preamble()` or directly
   when calling `Slurm_*apply`.
  
*  Added the function `opts_slurmR$reset()`.
  
## Bug fixes

*  `sourceSlurm()` was using a file created at `tempdir()` which was deleted,
   and thus, unavailable to be used by `sbatch`. Tempfiles like those are now
   created at `dirname(tempdir())`.

# slurmR 0.4-2

Minor release.

## Bug fixes

*  Fixes a user-message issue (not crucial) observed in Fedora and Solaris.

# slurmR 0.4-1 (CRAN)

## Bug fixes

*  Fixed bug when collecting failed jobs. slurmR would fail to
   correctly list failed jobs and thus to collect outputs. This would also
   would affect when trying to collect partially resubmitted jobs.
  
*  Slurm options passed via `opts_slurmR` are now passed to
   `Slurm_*apply` as documented. Thanks to Gregory Penn (gregorypenn) who
   reported the bug.
  
*  `slurmr_cmd` now expands the `cmd_path`.

## Misc
  
*  Increased code coverage.

*  The function `wait_slurm()` is now exported and documented.

*  Each line in the written R script is now wrapped with a custom
   `tryCatch` function (`tcq`). On error, this new function will collect both
   the expression called, the error message, and will quit the R session, so now
   the user has a better description of possible errors, e.g. missing
   packages.

# slurmR 0.3-0

*  Name changed from `sluRm` to `slurmR`.

# slurmR 0.2-0

*  JOSS review (finalizing).

# slurmR 0.1-0

*  Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
